                        When HLIs closed, there were only two months remaining in 
                        the academic year. HLIs will resume the interrupted term in
                        September 2020, and conclude the 2019-2020 academic in November 2020. 
                        They will reopen in December 2020 for the new intake and ensure 
                        they take necessary measures to follow the school calendar year 
                        that ends in May-June 2021.

                        Schools are advised to ensure they take necessary hygiene measures in 
                        preparation for reopening, including ensuring adequate washing facilities 
                        and making necessary renovations to enhance hygiene.
